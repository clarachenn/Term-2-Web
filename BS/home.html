<h3>About Brawl Stars</h3>

<p>Brawl Stars is a shooter game where players from all over the world can battle in the ultimate fight! As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new characters, upgrade your brawlers' stats, and even unlock new game modes! There are solo, duo, and 3v3 games. This game is free to download in many countries! The objective is different based on which game mode you play. There are seven different game modes in Brawl Stars, but you have no control over which game modes will be available to you at any given time, as they're randomly selected every 24 hours.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>This game requires you to hold your device like a video game controller. Your left thumb controls movement while your right thumb attacks. To attack, drag the button around to aim or tap the button quickly to rapid fire. As you cause damage, you'll power up your Super Ability. When this is fully powered you’ll see the yellow button on the right ready to go. You’ll need to hold it and drag to aim and thus target your super ability or you can rapid fire it to release right where you are. Each brawler's "Super" is different. (To learn more, check the "Characters" Page.)

 Your Brawler has two bars above their head. One is a health bar and the other shows your ammo.
 
 The more matches you play the more tokens you earn and these allow you to open Brawl Boxes. Brawl Boxes have new brawlers inside, tickets, coins and power points. The more you play the more tokens you earn and the more Brawl Boxes you can open.</p>

<h3>Why I Love This Game</h3>
<p> I love this game because it is easy to download and play with friends. I first downloaded it in March 2019 and have played every day since. I love playing duo showdown with my friends. I also really like the creativity of each character. Each brawler has its very own unique design and are great to use for different game maps.</p>
